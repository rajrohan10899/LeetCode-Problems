Youâ€™re checking for how many numbers from 1 to arr[i] are missing.

If arr[i] <= k, that means the current number in the array is not the kth missing number yet, so you increment k (since one missing number is skipped because the array has the number arr[i]).

When arr[i] > k, it means that the k-th missing number lies before arr[i]. So we break and return k.
